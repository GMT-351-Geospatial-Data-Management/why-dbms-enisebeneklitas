Explain why we need a DataBase Management System (DBMS) instead of a spreadsheet?

Databases store information more efficiently and it can handle data that is too large to manage in a spreadsheet.Spreadsheets have record limitations whereas databases do not. When a spreadsheet has many fields or a large amount of data (1000s of rows), the spreadsheet can be hard to read.

What are the advantages / disadvantages of using a DBMS (and specifically Postgres) compared to a spreadsheet (specifically MS Excel)?

Spreadsheets were originally designed for a single user. Databases are designed to hold  in high numbers information collections. Databases allow multiple users to access and query data quickly and securely at the same time, using a complex logic and language.
