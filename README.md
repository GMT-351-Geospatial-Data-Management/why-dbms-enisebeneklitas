Why we need a DataBase Management System (DBMS) instead of a spreadsheet?

Databases store information more efficiently and it can handle data that is too large to manage in a spreadsheet.Spreadsheets have record limitations whereas databases do not. When a spreadsheet has many fields or a large amount of data (1000s of rows), the spreadsheet can be hard to read.

What are the advantages / disadvantages of using a DBMS (and specifically Postgres) compared to a spreadsheet (specifically MS Excel)?

Spreadsheets were originally designed for a single user. Databases are designed to hold  in high numbers information collections. Databases allow multiple users to access and query data quickly and securely at the same time, using a complex logic and language.

The database features mentioned so far improve data integrity – you can’t store different types of data in the same field, and it is unlikely someone will mistake a data value for an outcome of a calculation, especially in large data sets. Data integrity is a strong advantage when working with databases.

Naturally, you might think a spreadsheet can contain multiple worksheets, so one can create tables in the worksheets, and then use the worksheets to create relations between the tables. Why bother using relational databases? Well, in a spreadsheet, such relations will be logically limited. Instead of setting up spreadsheets or worksheets, one can set up relations between the tables, and this will boost the performance of operations, increasing the speed with which you could manipulate your dataset.
